Day 6

Importing data in your mysql 

1. Download the classic models 
2. once the class models is downloaded 
	open a new sql editor in the DBBeaver :- 
3.  paste the contents of the classic model sql 
4.  alt + x (you should be connect to your mysql)
	start your mysqld (if not running )
	start you dbbeaver and get connected 
	then open the sqleditor and the add the contents 
	then only run alt + x 

5. the class model should have got imported :- 
	refresh 
	Right click on the databases and just say refresh 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
a) We saw that there is a database : 
b) We have a appliation how does a appliacation connect to database 
That SQL Statements needs to be invoked via a Java / Python / Node / C++/C# .net or some of code 
then only data will be reteieved by the application ? 

you will need to know first where is the database :- 
ip : localhost
what is the db port : 3306 
database Name : classicmodels 
user name " root"
password : "" 
data base Type : mysql 
from a programming language you need to connect then you need a driver 
JDBC :- Java Database Connectivity-----
Version of my database:- Driver corresponds to the version : 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What is the application going to do with the database ? 
a) Select Data and bring back to the user 
b) insert/update/delete data as per requirement  // update , select , delete , insert 
c) query views Table and view are select wise same : you cannot insert, update, delete from a view 
d) What else can my application decide  
	i) It may call procedures 
	What is procedures / functions why do i need them :- 
	wherever ther is large data manipulations this was dont with logic written in the database 
	a procedure = a logic written in the db side 
	procedure  method = input and returns output 
		create procedure xyz (in , out):
			xxxxxxxxx


SELECT :  QUERY 
			|------Statements  (Are literal statements and when they run they have full blown values with them 
								  select * from employee where empid = 1
								)

									select * from empid where emptid = +" (deletr)"+ 

			|------PreparedStatement
							    select * from employee where empid = ? 
UPDATE :  insert/Update /Delete 
CALLABLE : Procedure call 

How to write java program to connect to database :- ? 

1. You first need to set you driver in your classpath 
	You will need to download a appropriate driver and put in your classpath 

2. Write Code to connect to our database 
	STEP 1 : you will ned to first Load the Driver 
	STep 2 : then you will need to do the connection with the Database 
			*** most of the program fail or have issues because you open connectiosn and dont close it 
				this is known as a connection leak : a connection will shut or hang you applicatioj 
				if you open you connections and dont close them properly (LIMIT)

	Step 3: You will need to Create Statement/PreparedStatement and Decide its action 
			if the action is select   executeQuery()  // select works with executeQuery method 
			if the action is update   executeUpdate(); insert/update/delete ---> execute Update

	Step 4 : You have to also handle the exceptions ? 
			a) DB May be down 
			b) You may not be autthorized 
			c)  your password may be bad 
			d) you wrong query 





1. There will be a database engine : 
	MySQL 
	Oracle 
	SQLServer 
	DB2 
	Postgres

2.  What are the objects that are created in a datbase 
		Table 
		View 
		Sequences 
		Triggers 
		Functions / Procedures 

3.   SQL =: 
	  Select 
	  INsert 
	  Update 
	  Delete 


4.   min 
	 max 
	 avg 
	 sum 
	 count

5.  Orderby asc desc  muliti coolm order 

6.  Association 

7.  contraints 
		primary key 
		unique 
		foriegn key 
		not null 
		check constraints 


8.  joins 
		inner join 
		left join 
		right join 

		select x  from join y 


9.   group by 
	 having 


10.  truncate (allows me to delelte all rows)

11.  create table 
	 alter table 
	 drop table 


12.  Database also has types 


13.  AUTO_INCREMENT , SEQUENCES 



14.   Programatic connection to database ? 
	JDBC  Programs 
		Load the Driver 
			Class.forName("Driver Class");
			Connection con = DriverManager.getConnection(ur, , user, paswd);

			two types of thing 
				executeQuery 
				excuteUpdate 


15.  version where = ? is  having multiple like   = 


16. DBBeaver, SQLWorkbench or tools (Clients to databae )

17. -- is comment int sql file 

18.   Connection , ResultSet, Statement ,   java.sql. programming : 
 		 java + drivers in my classpath 


19.  Prepared Statements  

=============================================================================================================
What is noSQL Databases ? 

noSQL ---> no SQL beyond SQL 

what are the requirement of NOSQL Database..... 
1.  Volume
    by usage of horizontal scalling 
    it divides the data in mulitple instance : 
    a) We loose the Atomicity
    b) These Database Eventual Consitency 

0-10000                            10001 --20000                   20001 - 30000 
Instance 1 							Instance 2 						Instance 3 

NoSQL Runs on the Cheap COmmondity hw/ instance1 will have replica at somewhere else 

2. Variety ? 
	a) unknown strcuture --> What is going to come  
	b) semistrcuture 
	c) structured 


3. velocity : 

		Growth , Size of  frequency bu the data comes 


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Key Value Database 
Allow you to do the action of key value  
Key = value 

===========================================================================================================================
DOcument DB JSON 
-----> MongoDB
XML 
employee -- adddrwss -- street 

employee : {
	address  : {
		 street :  'M.G. Road'
	}	
} 
where employee.adrress.street = 'M.G. Road'
=============================================
Columnar Database : 
Cassandra 
Primart Key Violation does not exist (UPSERT )

===============================================
Graph DB 

===============================================





Cassandra Columnar Database 
Mongo Document Database 
Riak  Key=Value Db 
Neo4j Graph DB
========================================================================================================================

What do i loose in the database ?
Atomicity (NO)
Consitency (Eventual)


What do i gain from these database ? 
Volume
Redundancy 
Spread HOrizontal Accessibility 
Speed 




Grid Inmemory Databases (Caching Database)
REDIS 
Oracle Coherence 
Active Spaces 





Grid Cache db : 

IN memory Db ? 

=========================================================================================================================

Mongo DB :- 
IN mongo DB we will be using Document (Collections )


|------------------Collection 
					  |------- Documents 

					  				 |----json 
					  				 			{
					  				 				_id : for internal reference 	
					  				 			}


Does mongo db provide driver for java 

Start => Run -> services.msc -> MongoDB

mysqld you started to th mysql ==> 

mongod to start the mongo database :=> Data folder keep the data
